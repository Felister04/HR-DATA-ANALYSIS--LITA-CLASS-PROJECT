## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyze Attrition: Understand trends and drivers behind employee attrition.
- Examine Demographics: Explore characteristics like age band, department, and education field.
- Evaluate Job Satisfaction: Assess job satisfaction across different roles and marital statuses.


## Tool Used
- Power BI: For cleaning and creating an interactive dashboard to visualize findings.


## Data cleaning and preparation 

Data cleaning and preparation were performed using Power BI:

- Duplicate Removal: Checked for and removed duplicate records.
- Missing Values: Identified missing values and applied imputation or removal where necessary.
- Standardization: Standardized categorical variables (e.g., department names) for consistency.
- Conditional Columns: Created new conditional columns to categorize data (e.g., creating age bands).
- New Measures: Defined custom measures, such as average job satisfaction by department and attrition rate by job role.

## Power BI Visualizations and Measures

Key visualizations and measures were developed in Power BI to highlight significant trends:

- Attrition Rate by Department: Visualizes the attrition percentage across departments.

## Key Insights
This section summarizes the main insights gathered from the analysis:

- Attrition Trends: High attrition rates observed in R&D departments with 14% out of the 16% attrition rate
- Job Satisfaction Factors: Job satisfaction varies significantly by marital status, having more of the married people satisfied with thier job with job satisfaction count of 673, while the single had a count of 470 ans divored 327
- Attrition count and Age group and gender:25-34 age group has the most attrition count of 112 and the male gender dominated it with 69 count


## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following:

- Implement targeted retention strategies in departments with high attrition.
- Offer professional development programs to improve job satisfaction in marital status with lower scores.
- Review hiring strategies to better align gender with job roles.
