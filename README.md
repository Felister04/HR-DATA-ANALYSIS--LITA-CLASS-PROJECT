## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyze Attrition: Understand trends and drivers behind employee attrition.
- Examine Demographics: Explore characteristics like age band, department, and education field.
- Evaluate Job Satisfaction: Assess job satisfaction across different roles and marital statuses.


## Tool Used
- Power BI: For cleaning and creating an interactive dashboard to visualize findings.


## Data cleaning and preparation 

Data cleaning and preparation were performed using Power BI:

- Duplicate Removal: Checked for and removed duplicate records.
- Missing Values: Identified missing values and applied imputation or removal where necessary.
- Standardization: Standardized categorical variables (e.g., department names) for consistency.
- Conditional Columns: Created new conditional columns to categorize data (e.g., creating age bands).
- New Measures: Defined custom measures, such as average job satisfaction by department and attrition rate by job role.

## Power BI Visualizations & Measures

Key visualizations and measures were developed in Power BI to highlight significant trends:

- Attrition Rate by Department: Visualizes the attrition percentage across departments.
- Job Satisfaction by Job Role: Illustrates average satisfaction scores by job role.
- Marital Status & Job Satisfaction: Shows the relationship between marital status and job satisfaction.
- Age Band Distribution: Bar chart showing the distribution of employees across age bands.


Key Insights
This section summarizes the main insights gathered from the analysis:

- Attrition Trends: High attrition rates observed in specific departments and job roles.
- Job Satisfaction Factors: Job satisfaction varies significantly by role and marital status.
- Business Travel Impact: Frequent travel shows a correlation with higher attrition in certain roles.
- Education and Job Role: Certain educational fields are more prevalent in specific job roles.
   


### Conclusions & Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following:

- Implement targeted retention strategies in departments with high attrition.
- Offer professional development programs to improve job satisfaction in roles with lower scores.
- Review hiring strategies to better align educational background with job roles.
